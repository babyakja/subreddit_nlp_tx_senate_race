# NLP on the 2018 Texas Race using the Reddit API
## Objective
Using the tools learned in General Assembley's Data Science Immersive course, we will collect data via an API request and then building a binary predictor.
In particular, we will apply this in the realm of Reddit. Using NLP, what characteristics of a post on Reddit contribute most to which subreddit it belongs to? Our data will focus on Texas Senate race between Ted Cruz (R) and Beto O'Rourke (D).
Python Packages Used:
  - Pandas
  - Numpy
  - SkLearn
## Data Collection
Build function to scrapp reddit with inputs of _subreddit name_ and _number of pages to pull_
Reddit's API is limited to the last 1000 post for any subreddit, so how active a subreddit is can determine how frequently it is necessary to pull pages.
## Modeling
- Use GridSearch and Pipelines to find best predictive model
- Metric Targeted: __Accuracy__
## Findings
